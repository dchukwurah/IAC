   - Terraform was created by HashiCorp and used by many companies such as netflix to deploy and provision software

### 2. **Why Is It Needed?**
   - Terraform addresses the need for a consistent and unified workflow to provision and manage infrastructure across various cloud providers and on-premises environments.
   - It allows organizations to adopt Infrastructure as Code (IaC), making the infrastructure provisioning process more automated, consistent, and repeatable.
   - Terraform helps in managing the lifecycle of infrastructure using configuration files, enhancing the collaboration and versioning in infrastructure management.

### 4. **When Was It Made?**
   - Terraform was first released in July 2014. Since then, it has gone through various updates and versions, each enhancing its capabilities and features.

### 5. **Where Is It Used?**
   - Terraform can be used in various environments, including cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, and more. It is also applicable in on-premises data centers.
